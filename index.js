//Advance JavaScript - Hangman CLI 

//Workflow of the game - LOGIC 
//Make a CLI Hangman that allows a user to guess a letter 

//1. Use inquirer npm package
//2. Create constructors for word and letter 
//3. Word - current workd the person is trying to guess 
//4. Letter - use for the letter in the current work: either a or _ 

//Try to test with only word like Aldo and then something like Unites States
//Think of the Uppercase logic 
//User has 10 guess 
//There are 4 words to guess - Toyota, Honda, Lexus, Ford
//If no words guess to left then then end game 

//Guessed a letter will have to be recursive to display again 
//The then will have to work the function/constructors 

//Things to do - Today
//Npm init
//Npm install inquirer
//Upload to git 

//Work in the logic
